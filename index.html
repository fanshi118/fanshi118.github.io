        <h1>About me</h1>

        <p>Hello there.</p>

        <p>Welcome to my site. I'm currently studying Data Science at New York University. Originally from Beijing, China, I was an Electrical Engineering undergrad at the University of Southern California before moving to New York City in 2015 for my master's degree. I'm a downright data nerd and data scientist in the making.</p>
          
        <p>Currently, I'm a research assistant in the <a href="http://cds.nyu.edu/projects/cusp-urban-observatory/">Urban Observatory</a> (UO) at NYU's <a href="http://cusp.nyu.edu/">Center for Urban Scence+Progress</a> (CUSP). Meanwhile, I'm also working with <a href="http://www.argolabs.org/">ARGO Labs</a> on their street quality image project.</p>

        <p>My interest in data science is primarily in machine learning and its application in social network analysis. I do a lot of web scraping for my projects and sometimes just for fun. In addition, I have skills in interactive data visualization and read data journalism articles on a daily basis.</p>

        <h2>Things that I enjoy other than data science</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Basketball</li>
          <li>Nature Outing</li>
          <li>Good Movies (funny-as-hell tearjerkers are the best)</li>
          <li>Groovy Music (something jazzy and funky)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Stay in touch</h2>
        <p>I look forward to any opportunity through which I can exercise my data analytics skills. If my will is in line with your need, let's get coffee.</p>
